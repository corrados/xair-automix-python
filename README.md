# Python script to perform auto mixing based on measured signal levels for the Behringer X-AIR mixers.

This is work in progress...

## Debugging with X32 emulator by pmaillot

I have used an X32 emulator software by pmaillot to create the Python script. To compile and run
the emulator, you can use the following commands:

```
cd X32-Behringer
make
make X32
cd build
./X32 -i127.0.0.1
```
